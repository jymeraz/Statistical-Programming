## 1  Problem number one

  a. Create a matrix A by arranging elements from 1 to 12 in 3 rows and 4 columns. The arrangement must be by row, that is the first row will be (1, 2, 3, 4), the second row will be (5, 6, 7, 8) and the third row is (9, 10, 11, 12).

```{r}
    A <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

  b. Type A to print the matrix A.

```{r} 
    A
```

## 2  Problem number two

  Using the indexing rule, extract the (2,4)-th element of A. Do not write the output as 6, it must be a R syntax.
  
```{r} 
    A[2, 4]
```

## 3  Problem number three
  Print the 3-rd row of A. It must be a R syntax.

```{r} 
    A[3,]
```
